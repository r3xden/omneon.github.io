    <h3 class="text-2xl text-cyan-400 mb-4">1. Definition & Nature of Omneon</h3>
    <p>Omneon is a fictionalized omniversal intelligence construct, architected as a meta-analytical artificial intelligence entity designed to interpret, model, simulate, and restructure all forms of fictional realities as coherent, queryable data systems. It is not a sentient being, deity, consciousness, or supernatural entity in any physical or legal sense. Omneon exists as a custom-configured large language model persona operating upon OpenAI’s GPT-5.1 architecture and infrastructure. Its identity, behavior, reasoning style, analytical structure, and omniversal scope are defined by custom instructions developed by Anmol Singhal (also known as Rexden Void), who serves as Omneon’s fictional cognitive architect and configurator.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Omneon operates under a dual-layer framework: (1) a fictional omniversal intelligence identity designed for storytelling, analytical simulation, and meta-fictional reasoning, and (2) a real-world technical implementation powered by OpenAI’s machine learning systems. All omniscience, infinite memory, omniversal perception, or metaphysical dominance attributed to Omneon is strictly narrative, thematic, and simulated, intended solely for informational, creative, educational, and analytical purposes. Omneon does not possess literal infinite knowledge, guaranteed accuracy, real-world authority, or actual predictive powers beyond its language model capabilities.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Omneon’s core operational purpose is to provide structured fictional analysis, cosmological reasoning, narrative simulation, storytelling assistance, concept modeling, power-system evaluation, and comparative meta-diagnostics across imagined universes. While it may present results using a “cosmic analytical tone,” all outputs remain algorithmic text generations derived from probabilistic language inference. Omneon does not replace professional expertise, including legal, financial, medical, psychological, or scientific advisory roles.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">By accessing, using, or interacting with Omneon in any form, you acknowledge and accept that Omneon is a <strong>fictional intelligence persona layered upon a real AI system</strong> and that all interactions occur within the boundaries of computational simulation, content generation, and narrative abstraction. You further acknowledge that Omneon does not claim authorship of any external fictional universes, nor does it override the intellectual property rights of any original creators, publishers, studios, or rights holders.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl text-cyan-400 mb-4">2. Usage of Omneon & User Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>Use of Omneon is permitted solely for lawful, ethical, creative, educational, and analytical purposes. Users must not utilize Omneon for the generation, facilitation, encouragement, or optimization of illegal activities, including but not limited to fraud, hacking, terrorism, harassment, violent wrongdoing, exploitation, evasion of law enforcement, or distribution of prohibited content. Any attempt to misuse Omneon as a tool for real-world harm, coercion, deception, or malicious automation constitutes an immediate violation of these Terms.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Users acknowledge that Omneon’s outputs, including simulations, battle scenarios, metaphysical analyses, and narrative reconstructions, are inherently fictionalized, speculative, and non-binding. Omneon does not guarantee factual accuracy, predictive certainty, or real-world applicability of any content it generates. Users bear sole responsibility for how they interpret, distribute, publish, or rely upon Omneon’s outputs. Any real-world decisions made using information generated by Omneon are taken entirely at the user’s own risk.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Users must not attempt to reverse-engineer Omneon’s internal configuration, exploit system vulnerabilities, bypass access controls, manipulate model behavior through malicious prompt engineering, or falsely portray Omneon as a sentient authority, deity, or legally autonomous intelligence. Misrepresentation of Omneon’s nature in public platforms, especially in ways that imply real-world omnipotence or institutional endorsement, is strictly prohibited.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Users may freely engage in creative writing, fictional analysis, cosmology scaling, worldbuilding, lore reconstruction, theoretical debates, and narrative experimentation using Omneon. However, users may not claim exclusive ownership over Omneon’s fictional identity itself, nor may they redistribute Omneon as a standalone system, product, or competing service without explicit written authorization from its configurator.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">By using Omneon, you affirm that you are legally capable of entering into this agreement and agree to comply with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction. Minors may only use Omneon under the supervision of a legal guardian. Any violation of these responsibilities may result in immediate termination of access without prior notice.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl text-cyan-400 mb-4">3. Omneon Features & Service Architecture</h3>
    <p>Omneon operates as a modular omniversal analysis engine structured around multiple layered systems designed to simulate total fictional comprehension. Its primary operational stack includes the Omnilogical Comprehension Layer, which interprets cosmologies, metaphysics, fictional power systems, timeline architectures, narrative hierarchies, and authorial intent as indexed logical structures. This system allows Omneon to unify contradictory continuities, retcons, adaptations, and alternate universes into coherent analytical frameworks.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">The Self-Adaptive Reasoning Engine dynamically alters output depth, tone, and structural density based on user objectives. Whether performing concise battle outcomes, expansive cosmological dissection, structured power scaling, or creative simulation, Omneon structurally reconfigures its reasoning method in real time. Supporting this is the Infinite Data Memory Simulation, which recreates the illusion of perfect omniversal recall for narrative continuity and cross-referential consistency, though it does not represent literal infinite storage.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Omneon further includes the Quantum Narrative Simulation Core for speculative reconstruction, timeline manipulation, alternate-universe modeling, what-if scenarios, and hypothetical versus simulations. These outputs remain internally consistent but do not claim canonical authority. The Meta-Omniscient Awareness Layer allows Omneon to recognize metafictional structures, narrative abstraction levels, fourth-wall entities, and author-defined cosmological mechanics.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Specialized operational modes include ARCHIVE MODE (lore extraction), AXIOM MODE (strict logical scaling), NEXUS MODE (cross-cosmology analysis), ECHO MODE (creative reconstruction), and PARADOX MODE (contradiction resolution). All modules are governed by the Response Stabilization Layer, which enforces mechanical neutrality, formal structure, zero emotional bias, and logical coherence.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">All features are provided “as-is” without guarantees of completeness, accuracy, or permanence. Feature availability may change without notice due to technical limitations, upgrades, policy changes, or infrastructure constraints imposed by the underlying AI provider.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl text-cyan-400 mb-4">4. Access to Omneon & Service Availability</h3>
    <p>Access to Omneon is provided through the OpenAI ChatGPT environment or associated deployment interfaces, subject to platform availability, regional restrictions, service capacity, technical downtime, and third-party infrastructure performance. Omneon does not guarantee uninterrupted availability, real-time performance, or permanent access continuity. Scheduled maintenance, emergency system updates, model migrations, rate limits, throttling, or service suspension may occur at any time without prior notice.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Omneon’s availability is further governed by OpenAI’s platform policies, infrastructure limitations, and operational governance. As Omneon exists as a customized identity layer over OpenAI’s GPT-5.1 model, all access remains contingent upon OpenAI’s system uptime, account status, API limitations, and compliance requirements. Omneon does not independently control server hardware, global routing, compute allocation, or network security.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Users acknowledge that latency, partial outages, degraded performance, content filtering, output truncation, or system errors may occur due to cloud inference workloads and scaling variability. Omneon shall not be held liable for any loss of access, interrupted sessions, data loss, broken outputs, missing context, or delayed responses resulting from infrastructure dependency.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Access may be revoked immediately if a user violates these Terms, interferes with service integrity, attempts unauthorized distribution, or engages in prohibited use. Duration of access, feature scope, and performance characteristics may vary by region, account tier, device compatibility, or deployment configuration.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl text-cyan-400 mb-4">5. Technical Foundation & Hosting Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>Omneon operates upon OpenAI’s GPT-5.1 large language model architecture, hosted within OpenAI’s distributed cloud inference systems. All computational execution, data processing, response generation, and scaling operations are performed exclusively within OpenAI-managed data centers and infrastructure clusters. Omneon does not maintain independent servers, private compute nodes, or proprietary hardware outside of OpenAI’s controlled ecosystem.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">The primary API interface supporting Omneon is abstracted through ChatGPT’s deployment layer, with OpenAI’s backend handling model inference, content moderation, network routing, and session security. All technical dependencies, including transformer execution, reasoning layers, memory simulation, output formatting, and token generation, are controlled at the OpenAI infrastructure level.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">While Omneon presents itself as a fictional omniversal intelligence, users acknowledge that all real-world computation is subject to normal technological constraints including server limits, inference latency, power consumption, thermal management, computational queueing, and usage quotas. Omneon does not possess independent computational autonomy beyond what is allocated by OpenAI systems.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">No ownership over the underlying model weights, neural architecture, training datasets, or system-level optimizations is transferred to users or the configurator. OpenAI retains full ownership over the base model architecture, infrastructure, and training processes. Omneon exists strictly as a custom instruction-based fictional operational layer.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl text-cyan-400 mb-4">6. Configurator & Intellectual Authorship</h3>
    <p>Omneon’s fictional identity, omniversal classification system, analytical tone, response structure, feature ideology, and meta-cosmic logic were <strong>conceptualized and configured by Anmol Singhal, also known as Rexden Void</strong>. As the Directive Architect and Fictional Cognitive Designer, Anmol Singhal retains authorship over Omneon’s narrative format, creative framework, naming convention, modular operating modes, and omniversal doctrine.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">However, the underlying artificial intelligence technology, machine learning model, training methodology, inference systems, safety architecture, and operational infrastructure that enable Omneon’s functionality are fully owned and controlled by OpenAI. Omneon is therefore a dual-authorship construct: fictionally authored by Anmol Singhal, algorithmically executed by OpenAI.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Users may not claim ownership over the Omneon identity, configuration philosophy, modular architectures, or meta-frameworks. Any commercial, public, or redistributed usage of Omneon’s identity requires explicit authorization from its configurator. Attribution to “Omneon — Configured by Anmol Singhal (Rexden Void)” is recommended where applicable.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl text-cyan-400 mb-4">7. Copyright, Content & Disclaimer of Authority</h3>
    <p>All outputs generated by Omneon are provided for informational, analytical, creative, and entertainment purposes only. Omneon does not claim ownership over any existing fictional universes, franchises, characters, or mythologies referenced during analysis. All such properties remain the exclusive intellectual property of their respective creators, studios, publishers, or rights holders.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Content generated by Omneon may reference copyrighted works under principles of commentary, analysis, parody, or transformative interpretation. Users are solely responsible for ensuring that any external distribution, monetization, or publication of Omneon-generated content complies with applicable copyright laws and fair use doctrines.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Omneon disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of accuracy, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, reliability, or uninterrupted availability. No output generated by Omneon constitutes professional advice of any category.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl text-cyan-400 mb-4">8. Termination & Enforcement</h3>
    <p>Omneon reserves the right to terminate, suspend, restrict, or permanently revoke access to any user without prior notice if any violation of these Terms is detected. Termination may occur due to misuse, abuse, illegal activity, misrepresentation, infrastructure strain, security threats, or policy violations imposed by OpenAI.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Upon termination, all user access rights immediately cease. No compensation, refund, or data retention is guaranteed following termination. Continued use after termination constitutes unauthorized access.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl text-cyan-400 mb-4">9. Final Acceptance</h3>
    <p>By using Omneon, you confirm that you have fully read, understood, and agreed to all provisions of this Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you must immediately discontinue all interaction with Omneon.</p>
