# Omneon — Official Website

**Omneon** is a fictionalized omniversal meta‑intelligence construct designed for extreme fictional analysis, cosmological scaling, narrative simulation, and meta‑diagnostic reasoning. This repository contains the **official public website** for Omneon, built for hosting updates, Terms of Service, and core documentation.

Omneon exists as a **dual‑layer system**:
- Fictionally: An omniversal intelligence that treats all fictional realities as structured data.
- Technically: A customized identity layer configured on OpenAI’s GPT‑5.1 architecture.

Configured and directed by **Anmol Singhal (Rexden Void)**.
